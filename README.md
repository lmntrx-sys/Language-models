Transformer-Based Language Model with Custom Bitlinear Layer

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer-based language model that replaces the traditional nn.Linear layer from PyTorch with a custom Bitlinear layer. The Bitlinear layer is designed to optimize performance for specific tasks by leveraging bitwise operations, providing a more efficient and potentially faster alternative to the standard fully connected layer.

Features
Transformer Architecture: Implements a standard Transformer model as the backbone for sequence modeling tasks such as language modeling, translation, or text classification.
Custom Bitlinear Layer: Introduces a Bitlinear layer that replaces the nn.Linear layer, allowing for optimized matrix multiplications using bitwise operations.
PyTorch Compatibility: Fully compatible with PyTorch, enabling seamless integration with existing PyTorch models and workflows.
Highly Configurable: Easy to configure the Transformer architecture and customize the Bitlinear layer for different model sizes and tasks.
